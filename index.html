My interest in the fields of science and computers has allowed me to go out of my comfort zone and lead a journey of an enthralling adventure to explore magnificent things that a normal person may not. A bit contrary to this, I have always been deeply connected to books, fiction genre included. Because humanities is equally important. Fiction acts as an escape of present realitites and is a great source of enjoyment in my opinion. Also, a world only with STEM and no humanities is a terrible way to create the end of human race.<br>A man who is gifted has also been endowed with responsiblities, and thus he must use his genius for the development of the human race. I belive that one man can make a difference and if we believe in something, we must believe it firmly!</p>
